# Projects (DataCamp)
https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python

These are the projects I made from Data Scientist with Python career  track from DataCamp.

In this track, we learned how Python language allows you to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize dataâ€”all integral skills for any aspiring data professional or researcher. Through interactive exercises, we get hands-on with some of the most popular Python libraries, including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and many more. We then work with real-world datasets to learn the statistical and machine learning techniques we need to train decision trees and use natural language processing (NLP).


### TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game
In this project, we found out how some of the elements of the show interact with each other. We answer questions like:

* What are the most extreme game outcomes?
* How does the game affect television viewership?
* How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
* Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

The dataset used in this project was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with game data, one with TV data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.
