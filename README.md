# Projects (DataCamp)
https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python

These are the projects I made from Data Scientist with Python career  track from DataCamp.

In this track, we learned how Python language allows you to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize dataâ€”all integral skills for any aspiring data professional or researcher. Through interactive exercises, we get hands-on with some of the most popular Python libraries, including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and many more. We then work with real-world datasets to learn the statistical and machine learning techniques we need to train decision trees and use natural language processing (NLP).


## [TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game](https://github.com/anendozo/Projects/tree/main/A%20Visual%20History%20of%20Nobel%20Prize%20Winners)
In this project, we load, clean, and explore Super Bowl data. We found out how some of the elements of the show interact with each other. We've answer questions like:

* What are the most extreme game outcomes?
* How does the game affect television viewership?
* How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
* Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

The dataset used in this project was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with game data, one with TV data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.


## The Android App Market on Google Play
In this project, we load, clean, and visualize scraped Google Play Store data to understand the Android app market.
We do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We looked for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

The data for this project was scraped from the Google Play website. While there are many popular datasets for Apple App Store, there aren't many for Google Play apps, which is partially due to the increased difficulty in scraping the latter as compared to the former. The data files are as follows:

apps.csv: contains all the details of the applications on Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app.
user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.


## The GitHub History of the Scala Language
In this project, we are challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. We find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

The dataset includes the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.


## A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners
In this project, we use our data manipulation and visualization skills to explore patterns and trends over 100 years worth of Nobel Prize winners.
We answered questions like:
* What characteristics do the prize winners have? 
* Which country gets it most often? And has anybody gotten it twice? 

The dataset used in this project is from The Nobel Foundation on Kaggle.


## Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing
Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

In this project, we reanalyzed the medical data Dr. Semmelweis collected. 


## Predicting Credit Card Approvals
In this project, we build a machine learning model to predict if a credit card application will get approved.

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
